title: Welcome!  And Astrophotography
---

Thanks for visiting my site!  I plan on using this to post results of projects, both personal and professional, videos used for my classes, thoughts on education, photograph, hiking trips, and more.  I decided to remove myself from most of the social media sites in the run up to the 2016 elections and I have become convinced from a few sources I have read to substitute those with a personal website to fulfill lots of roles, and perhaps as a little bit of encouragement to follow through with some of the ideas I have.

The above is an image of M42, or the Orion Nebula located in the sword of the constellation of Orion.  The image is made up of about 3 hours of data taken with a Canon 5D Mark II and a AstroTech 72mm EDII refractor taken over 2 different nights a few months apart.  I am not done with imaging M42 and I will probably start afresh when I get a multipass narrowband filter and a field flattener I am waiting on.  Due to the SARS COV2 virus the shipping from China has been delayed for a number of items.

On the same night I took the following image of M51, the Whirlpool galaxy.  This image is actually of 2 galaxies colliding.  I am not very happy with the color, but I'll be reprocessing all of them with PixInsight, a dedicated piece of software used for processing (correcting), aligning, and stacking together many images.

For all of my astrophotography, and a list of the equipment used for each image, along with technical information on image times and so forth please visit my  <a href="https://www.astrobin.com/users/Roperb/">astrobin</a> page.
